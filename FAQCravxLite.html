      <h5>What all can I do with the Cravx Lite app?</h5>
      <p>With the Cravx Lite application, a business can easily create attractive offers and deals exclusively for
        college-going students to boost its revenues. Once the offers are added, it can keep track of how it is faring. To
        ensure data privacy and safety, we encourage partners to add sub-users who would have access to only redemption part
        thereby not seeing any sensitive data.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h5>Can multiple people use the same app?</h5>
      <p>We strongly recommend that you create sub-users for each of your customer-facing staff. This will ensure that there
        is no dependency on an individual at the same time the user will have access to the data which the sub-users cannot
        see.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h5>What are ‘Cards’ in the app?</h5>
      <p>Cards are nothing but offers created for a specific segment of users. These cards may be for a closed group of users
        or open to all. As a business, you may add your own offer to any of the cards visible to enhance your business
        opportunities.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h5>How does a user redeem an offer?</h5>
      <p>The process is quick, secure, and simple. Each offer comes with a unique QR code assigned to it. Whenever a user
        wants to redeem an offer, he/she will show the unique QR code in his app. The Cravx Lite app comes with a built-in QR
        code scanner which can read the contents and tell you which offer to provide.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h5>What if I wish to change an offer mid-way?</h5>
      <p>Though we suggest our partners not change offers mid-way to ensure stability, if you still wish to do so, you may
        connect with your relationship manager or write to us at support@cravx.com.</p>
