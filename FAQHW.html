      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>How do I register with HungryWungry?</h5>
        <p>
          Download the HungryWungry app and complete the one-time registration
          process. You will be asked to verify your mobile number and fill in
          basic details like your name, email address, date of birth along with
          state and city. You will also need to select your college from the
          list of colleges and upload a soft copy of your college ID card. The
          details submitted will be sent for verification.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>How do I know if my application is accepted or rejected?</h5>
        <p>
          In either case, you will be shared the status of your application on
          the email address provided. Additionally, the next time you try and
          login, you can also see the status there. If your application is
          accepted, you can log into the app and start using the services.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>
          What if there are errors in the form submitted for verification?
        </h5>
        <p>
          The details submitted in the application will be thoroughly verified.
          The ones where there is an issue either with mobile number or email
          address or the ID card is not readable, such applications are
          rejected.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>What if my college is not listed with HungryWungry?</h5>
        <p>
          If your college is not already listed, you can share the details of
          your college while filling up the registration form. The college will
          be shown in the list of colleges once our verification process is
          completed.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>What if my ID card is lost or damaged?</h5>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, there is no other way to verify that you are genuinely
          a student and studying in a particular college. If you are unable to
          furnish a soft copy of the ID card or your ID card is damaged to an
          extent where it is not possible to read the contents clearly, you may
          not be allowed to complete the registration process or your
          application may end up being rejected.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>What happens if my college listing request is rejected?</h5>
        <p>
          Students from a particular college will not be able to create an
          account with HungryWungry until the college's information is
          successfully verified by us, and the college is visible in the college
          list. In case of a college listing being rejected, we suggest
          re-initializing the listing process.
